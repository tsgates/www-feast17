# Call for Papers

Typical software engineering methodologies are largely focused on
programmer productivity and their methods have been known to introduce
significant execution inefficiency as a side effect.  Recent work
investigating efficient and timely software has attempted to enhance
software execution efficiency while preserving the source code-level
abstractions and object-orientation that enhance a programmerâ€™s
productivity.

Such efforts seek to undo the side effects on security and performance
overhead by reclaiming software execution efficiency and reducing
indirection, as well as performing automatic program de-layering and
program specialization (de-bloating).  Several promising results from
these efforts have demonstrated their viability in improving program
execution efficiency as well as reduction of the cyber security attack
surface.  As a result, the community may benefit by investing in the
development of tool ecosystems to take advantage of this recent
progress, to mature the technologies, and determine how best to
transparently deploy them.

## Scope

Despite some early progress within the research
community, software executable transformation is not a solved science.
Some critical problems reverse engineering and
binary understanding are, in the general case, undecidable.  Various
automated tools and ecosystems will need to be investigated
and developed to guarantee the effectiveness and
correctness of transformation efforts and to enhance and ensure the
security of transformed software.  The FEAST workshop will include
 topics geared toward:

- Understanding issues of software executable transformation for
  various programming languages and environment, and the potential
  methods for alleviating those issues.
- Identification of tools to be
  investigated and developed for guaranteeing correctness, enhancing
  security, and enabling non-critical/undesired feature removal
- Identification of layers and areas of computing systems that are
  suitable for and can benefit from software
  customization/transformation, along with identification of
  associated challenges and constraints, and the particular
  adaptation to the methodology needed to operate within the
  identified areas
- Automated extraction of models from software
  executables that are amenable to formal methods analysis and
  verification
