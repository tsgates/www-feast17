#### Generating site using jekyll

The website uses jekyll engine to generate the website using the templates.  To get started with jekyll:

    gem install jekyll bundler
    bundle install
    bundle exec jekyll build

To generate the website and serve it from a local webserver, e.g., for debugging

    bundle exec jekyll serve

## Overview

The repository is organized as follows:

* `_DOCS/`      are various files used to prepare other files, but not directly published themselves.

* `_config.yml` is a configuration file for the website, defining title, menu, and several basic parameters
* `_data/`      contains datasets in YaML or JSON format defining conference dates, news, and supporters
* `_includes/`  are supplementary scripts to generate website's content, including templates for menu, news, google analytics, and sponsors
* `_layouts/`   are layout files

* `css/`        CSS code. Only edit style.css, the rest is 3rd party.
* `css/images/` jquerymobile CSS images
* `images/`     Our images (logos, etc.)
* `js/`         Javascript. Only edit script.js, the rest is 3rd party libraries.
* `misc/`       Static documents served by the site: the calls for papers, PDF of the conference schedule, etc.
* `*.md`, `*.html` Individual pages in markdown or HTML format.

<!-- * `include/program`  Program listings, auto-generated by `scripts/proggen`. -->
<!-- * All publicly-visible pages are a .php in the top-level directory. Subdirectories contain something included in one way or another. -->

The site uses a bunch of 3rd party javascript libraries. You will want to use their latest versions:

* http://jquery.com/ - the javascript goes into `js`
* http://jquerymobile.com/ - the javascript goes into `js` and the CSS and images go into `css`
* http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.0/docs/_assets/css/jqm-docs.css - the CSS for the jquerymobile documentation page, goes into CSS
* http://code.google.com/p/css3-mediaqueries-js/ - the javascript goes into `js`
