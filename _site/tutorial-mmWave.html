<h3 id="call-for-participation">Call For Participation</h3>

<p>The past a few decades have witnessed tremendous penetration of wireless technologies on the microwave spectrum, especially through the WiFi and cellular networks. However, the capacity of such technologies is reaching a limit due to the limited amount of spectrum resource. In contrast, abundant spectrum exists at the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band. For example, around the 60 GHz mmWave band, 14 GHz of unlicensed spectrum is available, spanning 57 GHz to 71 GHz, about an order of magnitude wider than the microwave spectrum in use. This presents an opportunity for profound technological innovations via multi-Gbps indoor and outdoor networks, thus alleviating the capacity crisis facing mobile operators today.</p>

<p>Commercial interest in mmWave networking has been steadily increasing recently, with a main focus on commercializing short-range high-bandwidth mmWave radios based on recent IEEE standards (e.g., 802.11ad and 802.15.3c). However, the transformative potential of mmWave goes well beyond the current standards. The industry alliance has been exploring mmWave as an enabling technology for multi-Gbps cellular connectivity in 5G and beyond. The wide penetration of mobile mmWave radios is also bringing mmWave sensing to everyday life.</p>

<p>The objective of this tutorial is to present to networking researchers an overview of the unique characteristics of mmWave wireless communications, introduce the challenges and latest development in mmWave networking and sensing applications, and outline the future research problems in this domain. The tutorial will be provided by two speakers with complementary expertise in mmWave signal processing, network protocol design, and mmWave sensing applications. The tutorial content draws on insights from state-of-the-art in mmWave networking, as well as the speakersâ€™ years of research experience in modeling/measuring mmWave communication systems, and in designing mmWave testbeds, protocols and applications.</p>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>

<p>Despite the huge potential in increasing network capacity, mmWave networks face a number of challenges unseen in conventional low-frequency cellular and WiFi systems. mmWave radios commonly adopt many-element phased-array antennas to form highly directional steerable beams, which can leverage reflections to steer around obstacles. These unique characteristics of mmWave technologies require completely rethinking wireless network design from physical-layer signal processing all the way up to mobile applications. On the other hand, the commercialization of mmWave mobile devices is also triggering low-cost mmWave sensing applications, which used to be available only in dedicated environment for medical/security inspection. Together, short wavelength and high directionality translates into high sensitivity, enabling subtle object localization/tracking, vital-sign detection and mobile mmWave imaging. Given the critical role that mmWave will play in next-generation wireless networks and mobile devices, we expect the content to be timely and interesting for the SIGCOMM audience.</p>
