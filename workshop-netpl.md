### Call For Papers

The NetPL workshop provides a forum to bring together researchers and practitioners from the fields of programming languages, formal methods, and networking.

Recent technological trends, such as Software-Defined Networking, Network Functions Virtualization and reconfigurable networking hardware, have created an opportunity for researchers in these traditionally separate communities to collaborate, applying their diverse perspectives towards the development of novel networking applications. It is important to clarify that the scope of this workshop goes strictly beyond SDN. We aim to enable language specialists to better understand opportunities in networking, and networking specialists to better understand opportunities enabled by specially-designed languages.

This is the third NetPL workshop, after [last year's workshop](http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2016/netpl.php) at SIGCOMM and the [first edition](http://2015.ecoop.org/track/netpl-2015-workshop) at ECOOP. Talks in the previous editions of the workshop are on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqU8E2n4MHthZUVb1xK2nRQ).

#### Invited Speakers

The program will include invited talks from experts in the field, with an emphasis on encouraging engaging technical discussions amongst the participants.

Our preliminary program includes several illustrious speakers:

- Gordon Brebner, XILINX
- Nick McKeown, Stanford University
- Jennifer Rexford, Princeton University
- Mooly Sagiv, Tel Aviv University
- Boon Thau Loo, University of Pennsylvania

#### Topics of Interest

We are also soliciting contributions from prospective participants in the form of talk proposals to broaden the research that is discussed at the workshop.

Language-centric research of the following aspects of computer networks is in scope:

- specification and topology
- testing and measurement
- packet/traffic generation
- packet/traffic analysis
- security
- resource availability or control
- policy languages
- interoperability between networking-related languages
- composition of networking-related languages

Practical aspects of languages, particularly if oriented towards solving networking problems, are also in scope:

- how to model and prototype languages rapidly
- what semantic structures are best suited to the networking domain

We give no firm guidelines on topics (go wild but stay within scope!), however we particularly seek talks that can provoke thought and discussion.

#### Submission Instructions

Submit a position paper of at most 2 pages length, 10-pt font, which will be lightly reviewed by the workshop program chairs.

Paper submission can be done via HotCRP at: [https://sigcomm17netpl.hotcrp.com/](https://sigcomm17netpl.hotcrp.com/).
